My name is Çiğdem, but if it is sometimes difficult to pronounce, you can call me Esta. I know 'Esta' means 'This' in Spanish, I may seem like I'm introducing myself as 'This is Çiğdem Kahya' at first glance.
In fact, Esta meant 'starlike' in a language no longer used on earth. Because of my admiration for space, it has become a habit to add the word Esta next to my name in many of my social media accounts.

I am a Virgo woman.
I don't know how much you believe in horoscopes, but I use my horoscope as a keyword to talk about myself.
  Because yes, I have almost all the features mentioned. I am hardworking, meticulous and disciplined.
     I don't say this to brag because I've always believed that these traits are things like saying I'm happy or sad. Features whose meanings can change depending on how they look on you.
    My meticulousness wears me out, and I'm stuck there for weeks without going through a topic.
In the end, it is true that I have produced very good works and this is certainly a fact, but it wastes me a lot of time.
And I want to share with you my 2 precious life philosophies:

```
"Time is the most precious thing in life."
```


```
"If you really want something, the whole universe cooperates with you to get it."
```

I'm going to talk about myself a little more professionally now.

I entered college at the age of 17 on my first try and first choice. Turkish Language and Literature program.
I will never regret studying literature for the rest of my life, it has given me tremendous perspective and speaking ability. However, from time to time, I say 'I wish I had left literature as a hobby'.
Then, I used my second university preference right without an exam and moved to the Computer Programming department.

And on 05.09.2022, when I didn't even know how to do Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V, I suddenly decided to step into the magical world of software. When I started learning completely as a hobby, now I am an addict who cannot stop learning something new every day.
