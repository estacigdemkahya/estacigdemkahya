My name is Ã‡iÄŸdem, but if it is sometimes difficult to pronounce, you can call me Esta. I know 'Esta' means 'This' in Spanish, I may seem like I'm introducing myself as 'This is Ã‡iÄŸdem Butler' at first glance.
In fact, Esta meant 'starlike' in a language no longer used on earth. Because of my admiration for space, it has become a habit to add the word Esta next to my name in many of my social media accounts.
